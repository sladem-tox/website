Slade Matthews is a senior lecturer in toxicology and pharmacology at the University of Sydney. Slade's lab is the Pharmacoinformatics Laboratory.

The PharmacoInformatics Laboratory uses computer technologies to uncover new relationships in biomedical data. PharmacoInformatics incorporates the principles of computerised data management, machine learning techniques and complexity analysis in a pharmacology context. These techniques as well as applied statistics are used on a range of problems in this lab including clinical observational studies and studies based on analysis of laboratory data.
