abstract: In vitro genotoxicity bioassays are cost-efficient methods of assessing potential carcinogens. However, many genotoxicity bioassays are inappropriate for detecting chemicals eliciting non-genotoxic mechanisms, such as tumour promotion, this necessitates the use of in vivo rodent carcinogenicity assays. In silico IVRC modelling could potentially address the low throughput and high cost of this assay. We aimed to develop and combine computational QSAR models of novel bioassays for the prediction of IVRC results and compare with existing software.
