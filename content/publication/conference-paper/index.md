abstract: Many pharmacology departments use pharmacokinetic simulations to teach students about drug disposition. Unfortunately the cost of using licensed software is frequently prohibitive and departments are also keen to reduce costs or divert funds to research activities.We set out to create a new pharmacokinetic simulation program to address a current instructional need with both flexibility and low cost.
